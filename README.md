A simple app to display Live channels through Rofi. My attempt at giving back to the open source community. Disclaimer: the app is not as cool as the name is.

## How to install

Currently all we have is a sh file. If you have streamlink + rofi, add a file called `oauth` in the project root folder. Run it with sh/zsh/whateversh.

## TODO

- Extensibility, modularity, basically let the user decide on every part of the program

- Usability without oauth! This will probably be implemented in python

- Display current viewers

- Let user decide on output

- Rofi choice for video quality
